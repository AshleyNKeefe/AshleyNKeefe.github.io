        <br>
        <h2>Staff Nurse • July 2019 - July 2020</h2>
        <p>As a staff nurse in the operating room, I ensure safe and efficient patient care during surgical procedures. Responsibilities include preparing the operating room, assisting the surgical team, monitoring vital signs, and maintaining aseptic technique. I provide patient advocacy, emotional support, and education throughout the surgical experience. Additionally, I contribute to quality improvement initiatives and adhere to evidence-based practices to enhance patient outcomes. My goal is to uphold the highest standards of patient safety and professionalism while collaborating with the surgical team to deliver optimal care.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Nursing Supervisor • July 2020 - August 2022</h2>
        <p>As the weekend operating room supervisor, I oversaw the daily operations of the surgical suite. Responsibilities include coordinating surgical schedules, ensuring adequate staffing levels, and managing the efficient flow of patients and resources. They liaise between surgical teams, nursing staff, and hospital administration to maintain compliance with regulatory standards and promote a culture of safety and quality care. I also was the sole owner for maintaining and balancing the staff schedule for 100+ employees including call, weekend, and holiday shifts. Block utilization for the weekend staff was averaging 102% while I was leading the team and we had a 100% retention rate of staff.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Nurse Educator • August 2022 - Present </h2>
        <p>As a nurse educator, I develop, implement, and assess educational programs for nursing staff, students, and healthcare professionals. I provide mentorship, clinical instruction, and support across various healthcare settings. Additionally, I interview and onboard new staff with diverse healthcare training backgrounds. Current projects include standardizing the onboarding process, creating a communication tool for the Operating Room and Sterile Processing Department, and reducing the cost per case for surgical supplies. These initiatives aim to enhance operational efficiency, promote patient safety, and optimize resource utilization within the healthcare setting.</p>
