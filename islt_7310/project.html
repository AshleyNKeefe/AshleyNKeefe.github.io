    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <h2>Thanks for visiting!</h2>
    <p>I'm thrilled that you've chosen to visit. I'm Ashley, and this digital space serves as a window into my professional journey. As you explore, my aim is for you to gain a deeper understanding of both my professional expertise and personal characteristics. While a resume offers a glimpse into qualifications, it often falls short in capturing the essence of an individual. Here, I endeavor to paint a more comprehensive picture of who I am, both personally and professionally. So, make yourself at home, and let's embark on this journey together.</p>
