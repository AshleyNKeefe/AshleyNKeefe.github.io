<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ashley. I graduated from the University of Missouri with a nursing degree. I mainly work in the operating room, assisting in surgeries. I've been involved in many procedures throughout my career, starting with trauma surgeries, but now I prefer surgeries for kids. Currently, I'm helping to expand the trauma program and build a new hospital at Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Columbia, Missouri.<br>Besides work, I enjoy reading and playing video games. Diving into made-up worlds, exploring different places, and mastering strategies is my favorite pastime. Additionally, I'm studying business administration with a focus on healthcare management. My aim is to continue helping patients and enhancing their well-being, a goal I aspire to accomplish through my education.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Administration at the University of Missouri, with an expected completion date in fall 2025. My academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, which I completed in July 2022 at the University of Missouri with a GPA of 3.8/4.0. Prior to that, I earned an Associate Degree in Nursing from Columbia College in July 2019. My MBA program emphasizes Life Science Innovation and Entrepreneurship, reflecting my commitment to merging healthcare expertise with business acumen for future professional endeavors.</p>
