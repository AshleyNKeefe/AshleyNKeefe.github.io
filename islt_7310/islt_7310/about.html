<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Ashley. I graduated from the University of Missouri with a nursing degree. I mainly work in the operating room, assisting in surgeries. I've been involved in many procedures throughout my career, starting with trauma surgeries, but now I prefer surgeries for kids. Currently, I'm helping to expand the trauma program and build a new hospital at Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Columbia, Missouri.<br>Besides work, I enjoy reading and playing video games. Diving into made-up worlds, exploring different places, and mastering strategies is my favorite pastime. Additionally, I'm studying business administration with a focus on healthcare management. My aim is to continue helping patients and enhancing their well-being, a goal I aspire to accomplish through my education.</p>
